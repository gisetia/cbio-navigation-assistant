# Overlap Tab Guide
Understand how the Overlap tab highlights shared members across cohorts and how to control the downstream analyses. blop

* **Purpose:** Shows which samples or patients **overlap** (are present in more than one selected group) using a Venn or UpSet diagram (if 4 or more groups are selected).

* **Overlap Management:** When samples/patients overlap, a drop-down menu appears in the header allowing you to **Exclude** (default) or **Include** overlapping cases in analyses performed in other tabs.

* **Creating New Groups:** You can **click on one or more sections** of the Venn/UpSet diagram (e.g., the intersection area, or an area exclusive to one group) to select that subset of samples and create a **new custom group** from those areas by clicking on **Create Group From Selected Diagram Areas**.

* **Select Groups:** In the Groups bar, selected groups are highlighted in color; unselected ones remain grey. Use the “Deselect all” link in the Groups bar to clear all default selections, then click on each of the desired groups to highlight them. Only the highlighted groups will be used for the comparison analyses.
