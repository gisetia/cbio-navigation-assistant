# Navigating the cBioPortal Homepage
Search and select cancer genomics studies


## 1. Getting Started
The homepage lets you search cancer genomics studies, run gene- or case-based queries, and access tools for visualizing mutations, copy-number alterations, expression, and clinical data.

## 2. Choosing a Study

### **A. If you already know the study**
- Use the **search bar** with keywords such as cancer type, cohort name, or project.
- When multiple options appear, choose the study with:
  - Larger sample size  
  - More complete data types (mutations + copy-number + expression + clinical)

### **B. If you don’t know which study to pick**
- For pancancer exploration, select **TCGA PanCancer Atlas Studies** or the **Curated non-redundant studies** set for broad, high-quality coverage.
- For organ-specific exploration, filter by **Cancer Type** or use the search bar.
- Prefer **TCGA PanCancer Atlas** studies.
- When multiple options appear, choose the study with:
  - Larger sample size  
  - More complete data types (mutations + copy-number + expression + clinical)

### **C. If you need specific data types**
- Use the **Data Type** dropdown to filter by mutations, CNA, mRNA expression, protein, methylation, and more.

## 3. Choosing the Query Type

### **A. Gene-focused questions**
→ Select a study → click on **Query By Gene** → enter one or more genes → click on **Submit Query**

### **B. Cohort or clinical questions**
→ Select a study → click on **Explore Selected Studies**  

## 4. General Guidelines
- Hover over icons or labels for **tooltips** with extra information.  
- PanCancer and curated sets help avoid selecting redundant or overlapping datasets.
- Start with **PanCancer Atlas** when unsure.  
- Prefer studies with the most **complete data types**.  
- Use **Query By Gene** for gene-level analysis.  
- Use **Explore Selected Studies** for cohort-level exploration.
