# Available cBioPortal navigation tutorials

Below is a list of available cBioPortal navigation tutorials, a short explanation of each, and the link to the full tutorial.

### Tutorials overview

- Tutorial: [Single Study Exploration](tutorials/tutorial-single-study-exploration.md)

Brief guide to navigate a single study: cBioPortal main page, two ways to open a study (query box or Data Sets), key study-view tabs (Study Summary, Clinical Data, Heatmaps, CN Segments) and how to run a query.

- Tutorial: [Single Study Query](tutorials/tutorial-single-study-query.md)

How to query one or more genes in a study and interpret results. Covers running/refining queries, exporting data/sample lists, and key result tabs (OncoPrint, Cancer Types Summary, Mutual Exclusivity, Plots, Mutations, Co‑expression, Comparison/Survival, CN Segments, Pathways, Download).

- Tutorial: [Patient View](tutorials/tutorial-patient-view.md)

Inspect individual patients and samples: ways to open Patient View, walkthrough of tabs, and differences in available data across studies. Tabs include Summary, Genomic Evolution, Pathways, Clinical Data, Pathology Report, and Tissue Image.

- Tutorial: [Onco Query Language (OQL)](tutorials/tutorial-OQL.md)

Short explanation of OQL: syntax to define which alteration types count as “altered,” why to use it (customize inclusion of mutation/fusion/CN events), and note on default behavior (MUT, FUSION, AMP, HOMDEL shown on hover in OncoPrint).

- Tutorial: [Group Comparison](tutorials/tutorial-group-comparison.md) 

Compare clinical and genomic features of user-defined sample/patient groups; suite of analysis tools for group-level comparisons.

- Tutorial: [Pathways](tutorials/tutorial-pathways.md)
